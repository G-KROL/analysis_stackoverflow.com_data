This thesis focuses on solving the problem of technology selection to build commercial IT projects. The solution to this problem is to determine the maturity and strength of a given technology and its community by analyzing stackoverflow.com data. The starting point for this analysis is the results of the Stack Overflow Survey 2022 report and picking the ten most popular and the least popular technologies. This thesis is split into several stages of data analysis, from collecting raw data to the investigation itself and comparing individual technologies and their users over the years.
